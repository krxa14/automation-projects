## Weekly Learning Goals

### Week 1: Programming (Python & APIs)
**Project:** Multi-Source API Aggregator
- Call multiple public APIs
- Merge, clean, and analyze data
- Output CSV reports
- Handle errors and logging

**Skills:** Python basics, Requests library, JSON parsing, Error handling

### Week 2: Data Handling
**Project:** Data Validation & Transformation Pipeline
- Load messy CSV/Excel files
- Clean missing values, duplicates, invalid formats
- Generate summary statistics and charts
- Save cleaned and transformed data

**Skills:** Pandas for data manipulation, Data validation techniques, File handling

### Week 3: Workflow Automation (n8n)
**Project:** Automated Sales Data Pipeline
- Trigger workflow on schedule
- Fetch data from multiple sources (APIs, CSVs)
- Transform and merge data
- Save results and notify via email or Slack
- Include error handling

**Skills:** n8n workflows, nodes, triggers, Scheduling automation, Error workflows

### Week 4: LLMs
**Project:** AI Report Writer
- Input raw text or CSV data
- Prompt LLM to generate structured summaries or reports
- Validate output
- Retry failed API calls automatically

**Skills:** Prompt engineering, Controlling model output, API handling and cost awareness

### Week 5: AI Agents
**Project:** Multi-Step Assistant Agent
- Take user goal and break into multiple steps
- Use APIs, files, or local tools to complete tasks
- Produce final actionable result
- Log each step for traceability

**Skills:** Tool calling with LLMs, Multi-step reasoning, State management in agents

## Learning Approach

### Weekly Routine
- **Day 1:** Understand problem and plan project
- **Day 2-3:** Build MVP (minimum viable product)
- **Day 4-5:** Build challenge project, improve and refactor
- **Day 5:** Document work in README or notes

### Key Principles
- ✅ Finish every project, even if it's not perfect
- 📝 Focus on consistency, challenge, and documentation
- 🎯 Learn by doing while documenting growth
